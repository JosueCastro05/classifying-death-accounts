# Tests

This folder contains **unit tests and evaluation scripts** for verifying our code and models.

## What belongs here:

- `test_model.py`: Unit tests for model accuracy, data formats, etc.
- Future test files (e.g., `test_preprocessing.py`) as needed

## Notes

- Use `pytest` or `unittest` for consistent testing.
- Ensure code in `src/` is testable (functions, not jsut scripts).
- Optional: include evaluation metrics like confusion matrices here.
